# Project Details: JYOMARG

## Project Story

### Inspiration
JYOMARG was born from a simple yet powerful observation: the journey from learning a new skill to landing a career-defining role is often fragmented. Aspirants get lost in a sea of tutorials without a clear path, and professionals struggle to identify exactly which skills they are missing for their dream jobs. We were inspired to build **ABHI (Artificial Being for Human Intelligence)**—a dual-role AI that acts as both a Master Tutor and a Career Architect, providing a continuous, guided light for every step of the professional journey.

### What it does
JYOMARG is a comprehensive AI-powered career ecosystem. It features:
- **AI Tutor:** Generates deep, 5-tier learning roadmaps (Phase -> Week -> Day -> Topics) tailored to any domain.
- **Career Architect:** Analyzes skill gaps between a user's resume and specific Job Descriptions (JD), providing actionable advice and match scores.
- **AI Course Architect (LEARN):** Dynamically generates full courses from basic to advanced levels, including syllabus, content, and assessments.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Tracks learning progress with a premium "Deep Space Cyberpunk" UI.
- **Minimalist PDF Export:** Allows users to download clean, technical roadmaps for offline study.

### How we built it
The project is built on a modern, robust stack:
- **Core Intelligence:** Powered by Google's **Gemini AI** (Gemini 3 Flash Preview and Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash) through the `google-generativeai` SDK.
- **Backend:** A Python-based **Flask** application manages the session, API logic, and secure authentication.
- **Frontend:** Crafted with **Semantic HTML5**, **Vanilla CSS**, and **Modern JavaScript**. We avoided heavy frameworks to maintain extreme control over the "Deep Space Cyberpunk" aesthetic—utilizing glassmorphism, neon accents, and smooth micro-animations.
- **Tools:** Integrated `html2pdf.js` for high-quality, content-focused PDF generation.

### Challenges we ran into
- **Prompt Engineering for Depth:** Generating a 6-8 month roadmap with daily topics requires managing massive JSON structures. We had to iterate on prompts to ensure structural integrity without sacrificing speed.
- **UI Complexity:** Displaying 5 levels of hierarchical data (Phases, Weeks, Days, etc.) in a way that feels intuitive and not overwhelming was a significant design challenge.
- **Performance vs. Detail:** Balancing the "Master Career Architect" persona's need for deep technical detail with the user's desire for fast response times led us to experiment with multiple Gemini model tiers.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
- **ABHI AI Core:** Successfully implementing a dual-persona AI that seamlessly switches between a friendly tutor and a professional career advisor.
- **Recursive Roadmap Logic:** Building a system that can generate over 200+ unique, interconnected learning topics in a single request.
- **Futuristic UX:** Developing a UI that feels premium, alive, and futuristic, providing a "Cyberpunk" experience that makes learning feel like an adventure.

### What we learned
- **AI Model Selection:** We learned that different tasks require different models; some benefit from the "depth" of models like Gemini 3, while others need the "speed" of Flash-tier models.
- **State Management:** Managing complex user progress across generated courses taught us a lot about robust local storage and API synchronization.
- **PDF Styling:** We discovered the nuances of css-paged media and how to translate fixed-layout glassmorphism into clean, readable print formats.

### What's next for JYOMARG
Our vision for JYOMARG is just getting started:
- **Voice-Enabled ABHI:** Integrating real-time voice conversations for hands-free learning and interview simulation.
- **Industry Exam Simulation:** Advanced assessments that include live coding sandboxes and industry-standard certifications.
- **Community Learning:** Enabling users to share their AI-generated roadmaps and collaborate on "Skill Quests" in real-time.
